1. src contains the code. It contains three files, project1.m, project2.m and project3.m which correspond to the generation of Fig 7, 8 and 9 in "Accessing the Hidden Available Spectrum in Cognitive Radio Networks under GSM-based Primary Networks"[1]
2. results contain the plots generated on running the code in src. part1.png corresponds to when SU's are near the BS. part2_160_incorrect is the plot given in [1] for SU's near the PU, which is incorrect, because it is obtained by putting MS=160 in the code for part1. The correct figure we obtained is part2_20_incorrect. SU_throughput.png corresponds to project3.m
